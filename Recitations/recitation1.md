Complete the following activity

Objective:

Learn to use R to solve a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) problem, including calculating genotype frequencies, testing for equilibrium, and visualizing results (5 questions).

#### 1. Introduction to Hardy-Weinberg Principle

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that in a large, random-mating population with no mutation, migration, or selection, the allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations.

Imagine a population where the genotype counts are:

-   AA =50
    
-   Aa=30
    
-   aa=20
    
We'll calculate allele frequencies, expected genotype frequencies under HWE, and test for equilibrium using R.

```r
##### Step 1: Input Data

# Genotype counts
AA <- 50
Aa <- 30
aa <- <<QUESTION 1: what should this number be?>>

# Total population size
N <- AA + Aa + aa
N
```
